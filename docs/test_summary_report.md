Recommendations
### Resolve Email System Issues:
Investigate SMTP settings (System > Settings > Mail) and server logs.
Retest affected test cases (REG-001, TC_PWD_001 to TC_PWD_025, TC_CU_006, TC_CU_009).
### Fix Critical Bugs:
Prioritize REG-001 and TC_CU_006 to restore core functionality.
Retest Failed/Inaccessible Cases:
Re-execute 32 test cases after fixes.
Regression Testing:
Validate passing test cases (e.g., TC_CKOUT_001 to TC_CKOUT_021) post-fix.
### Next Steps:
Proceed to performance testing (load/stress) after resolving critical bugs.
Consider automation for regression testing.
